# Book Reviews Project
This project is aimed at predicting whether a person liked a book or not based on their book review. We designed and implemented a machine learning model in Python that analyzes book reviews and makes predictions about the reviewer's opinion.

### Data
gathered and cleaned data from the website https://www.goodreads.com/ . The dataset contains over 100,000 book reviews, with each review consisting of a textual review and a binary label indicating whether the reviewer liked the book or not.

### Methodology
I conducted exploratory data analysis to identify trends and patterns in the data. Then, I engineered relevant features from the textual data using natural language processing techniques. I utilized the AdaBoost machine learning algorithm that gave the best results to train and evaluate the model.

### Results
My model achieved an accuracy of 57% on the test dataset.
